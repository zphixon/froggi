; full specification of most page items is as follows:
;     (:text user-item (* builtin-styles) "some text")
;     (:builtin-item user-item (* builtin-styles) (some) (children))
; every page item must have at least one "attribute," but they are all optional.

; special built-in page item is the style item: {...}
; takes a list of (item styles...) to apply to items in the page.
{(:text serif (fg "303030"))
 (quote-box (bg "fff8dc"))
 (quote-text sans (fg "606060"))
 (footnote (fg "757575") sans italic)}

; TODO
; special built-in page item is the binary reference: (& "name"),
; which refers to object "name" at the end of the server's response.
;(:box ("Lorem ipsum example") (& "header.jpg"))

; strings are automatically concatenated. without a :builtin-item, the page
; item is assumed to be :text.
({mono underline} "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod"
 " tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.")

; items in a :box will be added to the page horizontally rather than vertically.
(:box quote-box
 (quote-text "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply"
  " random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature")
 (quote-text "from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard"
  " McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in")
 ; items in a :vbox will be added to the page vertically.
 (:vbox
  (quote-text "Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin")
  (:text footnote {(fill "20")} "from https://www.lipsum.com/")))
